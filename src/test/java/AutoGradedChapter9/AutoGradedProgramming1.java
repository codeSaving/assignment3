    Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, design a class named Rectangle to represent
     a rectangle. The class contains:

Two data fields named width and height.
A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height. The default values are 1 and 2 for
the width and height, respectively.
A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
Implement the class. Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 and height 40 and the
other with width 3.5 and height 35.9. Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.
